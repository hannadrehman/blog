##### Introduction
If you code a little bit, you already know some text editors or IDE’s that help you with your daily development, like VsCode, Atom, Sublime Text, Webstorm, Pycharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, etc. They are all excellent at code formatting, syntactical analysis, integrated terminal, testing, plugins manager, and so on.


##### Introducing Neovim
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a fork of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) that is an improved clone of [Vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). The original Vi code was written by [Bill Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy) in 1976.

Neovim is aiming to improve the codebase, allowing for easier implementation of APIs, improved user experience, and plugin implementation.

##### Why is NeoVim a good option for developers?

- It's open source and free.
- Blazingly fast.
- Customizable with a huge ecosystem of plugins.
- Treesitter and Language Server Protocol (LSP) are supported, but some configuration is required.
- It is a cross-platform software, it works pretty much everywhere (Linux, Windows, and macOS).
- Everything you'll ever do in Vim will be done with your keyboard. Say goodbye to your mouse.
- It runs in your terminal.
- Low CPU/RAM usage.


The only downside to using Neovim/Vim is that you need to invest a good amount of time learning and configuring it.
There is an initial learning curve. But once you pass that time, your productivity increases exponentially.

This blog is not about how awesome Neovim/Vim is. Maybe I will write another blog some other time.
So here are the top neovim plugins that every developer needs.
