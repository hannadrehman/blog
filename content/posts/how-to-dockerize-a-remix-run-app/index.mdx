##### Introduction

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a React server and browser runtime which provides out of the box server side rendering, snappy page loads and instant transitions with near-zero configuration.


In this blog post, we will showcase how to Dockerize a Remix application


##### Requirements

-Working [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installation installation

-Working [Remix](https://remix.run) installation

-Basic understanding of how a Node.js application is structured.



##### The Dockerfile

To Dockerize your remix app you need to create a `Dockerfile` in the root of you app
A `Dockerfile` is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images
In a simple docker file we would
-1. Install dependencies
-2. Build our application
-3. Setup environment variables
-4. Setup start command which will run the application


Create an empty file called Dockerfile:
```sh
touch dockerfile
```

 Add following instructions

```
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/server/app

COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY ./ .
RUN npm run build # will build remix app
CMD ["npm", “run” ,"start"] # will start remix app

```


##### Building your image
Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image.
```sh
docker build -f./Dockerfile . -t remix/run
```
The -t flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to find later using the docker images command:

Your image will be list by docker now

```sh
 docker images
```

```sh
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
remix/run    latest    86dae0f4dff9   3 minutes ago   470MB

```


##### Run the image
```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d remix/run
```
Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container.

Go to localhost:3000 and your application should be running


##### View Running Containers
```sh
docker ps
```

```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
4d039e503335   remix/run   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   20 seconds ago   Up 19 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, :::3000->3000/tcp   nostalgic_booth

```
If you want to see logs of your application run

```sh
docker logs <container-id>
```

If you want to go inside your container

```sh
docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
```
