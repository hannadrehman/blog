title: How to Dockerize a Remix App

description: Dockerizing remix apps is crucial for production environments as it takes away the burden of setting up a runtime environment for your app. Docker containers are predictable, consistent, and isolated in nature which makes it possible for them to run anywhere.

##### Introduction

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a React server and browser runtime that provides out of the box server side rendering, snappy page loads, and instant transitions with near-zero configuration.


In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to Dockerize Remix applications.


##### Requirements

- Working [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installation.
- Working [Remix](https://remix.run) installation.
- Basic understanding of how a Node.js application is structured.



##### The Dockerfile

In order to dockerize your remix app, you need to create a `dockerfile` at the root of your application.
Dockerfiles are simple text files containing instructions on how to create Docker images.

In a simple docker file we would:

- Install dependencies.
- Build our application.
- Setup environment variables.
- Setup the start command that will run the application.


Create an empty file called Dockerfile:
```sh
touch dockerfile
```

Let's start by defining what image we want to build from.
Here, we will use the `16-alpine` version of `NodeJS` that can be found on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)

```
FROM node:16-alpine
```

We will now create a directory for the application code inside the Docker image.
This will be the working directory for your application

```
//directory
WORKDIR /usr/server/app

```
Since `NodeJS` and `npm` are pre-installed in this image, the next step is to install the `remix` app's dependencies.

```
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install

```
Note that we are only copying the `package.json` instead of copying the entire source code.
This enables you to take advantage of Docker layer caching. A good explanation of this can be found [here](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/docker-layer-caching/).

The next step would be to copy the entire source code.
```
COPY ./ .

```

At this point, our source code and dependencies are all set in our Docker image.
The next step is to build the remix app and set some environment variables.
```
RUN npm run build # will build remix app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

```

Finally, we define the command to run our remix app using `CMD`.

```
CMD ["npm", “run” ,"start"]

```

In summary, this is what our `dockerfile` looks like.
```
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/server/app

COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY ./ .
RUN npm run build
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["npm", “run” ,"start"] # will launch the remix app when we run this Docker image.

```

##### .dockerignore file
Create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.
Add following content:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log

```
This prevents your local modules and debug logs from being copied onto your Docker image.


##### Building your image

Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image.
```sh
docker build -f./Dockerfile . -t remix/run
```
The `-t` flag lets us tag our image so that it's easier to find in our list of docker images.

Your image will be listed by Docker now.

```sh
 docker images
```

```sh
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
remix/run    latest    86dae0f4dff9   3 minutes ago   470MB

```


##### Run the image


```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d remix/run
```
When you run your image with `-d`, the container runs in detached mode. It now runs in the background
The `-p` flag redirects a public port (host's port) to a private port inside the container.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and your application should be running.


##### View Running Containers
If you wish to see all running Docker containers, you can run `ps` command.
```sh
docker ps
```


```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
4d039e503335   remix/run   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   20 seconds ago   Up 19 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, :::3000->3000/tcp   nostalgic_booth

```

If you wish to see the logs of your application.

```sh
docker logs <container-id>
```

If you want to go inside your container.

```sh
docker exec -it <container id> /bin/sh
```
