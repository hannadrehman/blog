title: How to Dockerize a remix run app

description: Dockerizing remix app is crucial for production environments as it takes away the burden on setting up a runtime environment for ur app. docker containers are predictable, consistent and isolated in nature which makes it possible for them to run anywhere.

##### Introduction

[Remix](https://remix.run) is a React server and browser runtime which provides out of the box server side rendering, snappy page loads and instant transitions with near-zero configuration.


In this blog post, we will showcase how to Dockerize a Remix application


##### Requirements

- Working [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installation installation
- Working [Remix](https://remix.run) installation
- Basic understanding of how a Node.js application is structured.



##### The Dockerfile

To Dockerize your remix app you need to create a `Dockerfile` in the root of you app
A `Dockerfile` is a simple text file that consists of instructions to build Docker images
In a simple docker file we would

- Install dependencies
- Build our application
- Setup environment variables
- Setup start command which will run the application


Create an empty file called Dockerfile:
```sh
touch dockerfile
```

The first thing we need to do is define from what image we want to build from.
Here we will use the `16-alpine` version of node available from the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/node):

```
FROM node:16-alpine
```

Now we need to create a directory for the application code inside the docker image.
this will be the working directory for your application:
```
//directory
WORKDIR /usr/server/app

```

In this image `Nodejs` and `npm` will be pre installed. so the next thing to do is install all dependencies of your remix app
```
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install

```
Note that we are only copying `package.json` instead of copying entire source code.
this helps in taking advantage of docker layer caching . a good explanation of this is can be found [here](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/docker-layer-caching/)

Next step would be to copy entire source code.
```
COPY ./ .

```

At this point our source code and dependencies are all set in our docker image. next we need to build our remix app and set some environment variables
```
RUN npm run build # will build remix app
ENV NODE_ENV=production

```

Finally we define the command to run our remix app using `CMD`

```
CMD ["npm", “run” ,"start"]

```


To sum it all here is what our `dockerfile` looks like
```
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/server/app

COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY ./ .
RUN npm run build
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["npm", “run” ,"start"] # will start remix app when we run this docker image

```

##### .dockerignore file
Create a `.dockerignore` file in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`.
add following content:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log

```
This prevents your local modules and debug logs from being copied onto your Docker image


##### Building your image

Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image.
```sh
docker build -f./Dockerfile . -t remix/run
```
The `-t` flag lets us tag our image so that it's easier to find in our list of docker images.

Your image will be listed by docker now

```sh
 docker images
```

```sh
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
remix/run    latest    86dae0f4dff9   3 minutes ago   470MB

```


##### Run the image


```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d remix/run
```
Running your image with `-d` runs the container in detached mode, the container is now running in the background.
The `-p` flag redirects a public port (host os port) to a private port inside the container.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and your application should be running


##### View Running Containers
if you want to see all running docker containers you can run `ps` command.
```sh
docker ps
```


```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
4d039e503335   remix/run   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   20 seconds ago   Up 19 seconds   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp, :::3000->3000/tcp   nostalgic_booth

```

If you want to see logs of your application run

```sh
docker logs <container-id>
```

If you want to go inside your container

```sh
docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
```
