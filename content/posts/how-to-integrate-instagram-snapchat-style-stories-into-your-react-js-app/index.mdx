##### Introduction
Snapchat Stories, which debuted in October 2013, was a new way of sharing our lives with the rest of the world.
Users may post their photographs in a narrative manner that others could watch as many times as they wanted for up to 24 hours.
Although we are all familiar with the notion now, this was a breakthrough moment in the history of social media.
Social media users grew more raw, real, and relatable as a result of this real-time documentary format.
Other social networks picked up on the Stories concept a few years later.
Today's social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube, and Whatsapp, all have stories built in, therefore it's only natural that your online application does as well.

#### Introducing React Stories component.
[React Stories](https://github.com/hannadrehman/stories-react) is a light weight (3kb) gzipped component which implements Instagram/Snapchat like stories


#### Setting up the project
We will use [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/) in this project

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app

```

#### Install stories-react npm package

```shell
npm install stories-react â€”save
```

#### Start your react project

```shell
npm start
```

#### Create Stories component

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Stories from 'stories-react';
import 'stories-react/dist/index.css';

export default function ImagesStories() {
 const stories = [
   {
     type: 'image',
     url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/9470805/pexels-photo-9470805.jpeg?w=300',
     duration: 5000,
   },
   {
     type: 'image',
     duration: 6000,
     url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/9733197/pexels-photo-9733197.jpeg?w=300',
   },
   {
     duration: 7000,
     type: 'image',
     url: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/9470805/pexels-photo-9470805.jpeg?w=300',
   },
 ];

 return (
     <Stories
       width="400px"
       height="600px"
       stories={stories}
     />
 );
}

```
<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/react-stories-b6yos?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
     style="width:100%; height:800px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;margin-top:48px"
     title="react-stories"
     sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
   ></iframe>

That is all there is to it. Now your project has Stories embedded in it.
